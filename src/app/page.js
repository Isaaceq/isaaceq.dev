            This project involved leading the development of a comprehensive
            design system at Dell Technologies, which included creating over 10
            interactive chart components like area, bar, and line charts using
            amCharts and JavaScript. These components, along with reusable
            elements like legends, were featured in the Dell Design System.
            Native charting libraries for Vue.js and React were also built for
            easy integration. The entire suite was documented and showcased
            using Storybook, significantly improving development efficiency and
            collaboration.

            I developed and launched a new website for Premier Merchant
            Services, a provider of credit card processing and e-commerce
            payment solutions. The primary goal was to create a modern,
            professional online presence that clearly communicates their
            services and value proposition. Using Next.js and React, I built a
            fast, responsive, and user-friendly site designed to enhance visitor
            engagement and provide a seamless experience across all devices. The
            project focused on delivering a clean aesthetic and intuitive
            navigation to reflect a contemporary feel for the financial services
            company.

                  &quot;I would leap at the chance to work with Isaac, again. We had
                  been on the same team for four years, and Isaac was a joy to
                  work with. Most of the time we were together, we were both
                  working on the data visualization portion of our design
                  library. 
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Isaac covered a lot of the innovative solutions we
                  needed for full-on chart implementation to essential shared
                  elements. Isaac&apos;s great at picking up on things he&apos;s
                  not familiar with - case in point, we were all introduced to
                  the amCharts library as part of our refactoring of the data
                  visualization components, and he learned the inner workings
                  very well, very quickly. He&apos;s also great at explaining
                  code and coding concepts in ways that are friendly to the
                  listener and easy to adopt.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  He has always been on the best working behavior, and is a
                  pleasure to work with. He became not only a great co-worker
                  but a good friend as well.&quot;

                  &quot;I&apos;ve had the pleasure of working with Isaac on multiple projects, and his ability to bridge the gap between engineering and design is truly exceptional.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  One of my favorite aspects of pairing with Isaac on a project is his gift for explaining complex technical concepts in a way that is easy to understand. His ability to communicate effectively not only accelerates collaboration but also elevates the entire team&apos;s understanding of technical
                  possibilities and constraints.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Isaac has been an integral part of building our Data Visualization library at Dell, and his impact cannot be overstated.&quot;

                  &quot;I had the pleasure of working with Isaac on the Dell Design System, and I can confidently say heâ€™s an solid engineer and teammate. He demonstrated end-to-end expertise, contributing not only to our core components and libraries but also spearheading the release of our initial data visualization
                  libraries. Isaac stands out for his willingness to collaborate across disciplinesâ€”he actively partnered with designers, product managers, and fellow engineers to shape and refine our solutions.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  His efforts didnâ€™t stop with developing top-quality code: Isaac also led demos, webinars, and enablement sessions to ensure our internal product teams were fully equipped to use our design system effectively. His enthusiasm for both problem-solving and knowledge-sharing made him a go-to resource who
                  consistently fostered team growth. If youâ€™re looking for a talented and collaborative engineer who excels at driving innovation, you&apos;ll be lucky to have Isaac.&quot;
